# AlmaLinux Mirror Propagation Report

This service provides information about the status of the AlmaLinux mirrors. The
report shows the time it takes for updates to propagate to the mirrors, as well
as the number of mirrors that have been updated. This information can be used to
identify mirrors that are not up to date, and to troubleshoot any problems with
the mirror propagation process.
